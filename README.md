# CFR-RockPaperScissors
Simple machine learning program that utilizes Counterfactual Regret Minimization to generate Nash Equilibrium for Rock Paper Scissors.


getAvgStrategy() function allows for user input to calculate an exploitative strategy based on holes in opponents probability distribution


avgStrategyNoHuman() function allows for CFR to train against itself and calculate the GTO/Nash Equilibrium probability distribution that is not exploitable by any strategy.
